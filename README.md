# World Layoffs Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview

This project involves **cleaning and analyzing** the **World Layoffs** dataset to improve data quality and extract meaningful insights. The **data cleaning** process ensures consistency, accuracy, and completeness, while **EDA** helps uncover trends, patterns, and key insights into layoffs across industries, companies, and time periods.

## 1. Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Remove Duplicates**: Ensured data uniqueness by eliminating duplicate rows.  
2. **Standardize the Data**: Applied consistent formatting to columns like `industry`, `company`, and `location`.  
3. **Handle NULL or Blank Values**: Replaced missing or empty values where necessary.  
4. **Remove Unnecessary Columns**: Dropped irrelevant columns to optimize the dataset for analysis.  

### Outcome

- Cleaned, structured, and standardized dataset for accurate analysis.  
- Ready for further **exploratory data analysis** (EDA).

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

1. **Data Overview**: Explored dataset structure and key variables.  
2. **Trends & Patterns**: Analyzed layoffs by industry, country, and year.  
3. **Company Insights**: Identified companies with the highest layoffs.  
4. **Rolling Totals**: Implemented a cumulative layoff trend over time.  
5. **Rankings & Comparisons**: Ranked top companies affected by layoffs each year.  

### Outcome

- **Key trends and insights** into layoffs across industries and time periods.  
- **Rolling totals and rankings** to measure the long-term impact of layoffs.
